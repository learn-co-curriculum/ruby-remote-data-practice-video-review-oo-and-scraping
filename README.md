# Video: OO Scraping Review

## Overview

In this two part video review, we'll cover the history of Object Orientation, a basic overview of writing tests, and creating objects from data that we've scraped. In this walkthrough, we'll work with data that we've scraped from Wikipedia. 

## Objectives

- Explain Esdger Dijkstra's influence on programming
- Write tests that describe our objects
- Define Hook, class getter and constructor method for our class
- Define a class constructor method to scrape from a data source and return a hash of properties
- Dynamically assign attributes for our instance using the `send` method
- Use the tap method to fix 'sandwich code' and dynamically assign properties
